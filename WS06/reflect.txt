In workshop 6, I practiced how to define and implement copy instructor and copy assignment operator. They are both the process of copying the member value from another object to the current object. When doing the copy for dynamically allocated members, I need to make sure I am not pointing my current object to the new object address, instead, I am getting a copy from the new object to my current object address. Furthermore, we can prohibit this process by adding keyword 'delete' to the prototype. It instructs the compiler to not insert the copy operations.
Other things I did were getting the data from the file and a friend class. Friend class is letting one class access another class's data member. To get the data from a text file or CSV file, we use the 'fstream'. Inside the 'fstream', we use the 'ofstream' and 'ifstream' which are similar to 'istream' and 'ostream' in 'iostream'.

In milestone 1, I practiced implementing operator overloading and some content in the first few weeks. I am more clear about how to implement operator overloading now, but the input data validation is hard to do sometimes.
